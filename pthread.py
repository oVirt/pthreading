pthread provides a Python bindings for POSIX thread synchronization
primitives. It implements mutex and conditional variable right now,
but can be easily extended to include also spin locks, rwlocks and
barriers if needed. It also does not implement non default mutex/condvar
attributes, which also can be added if required.
